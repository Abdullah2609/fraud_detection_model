## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Recommended: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fraud_detection.git
   cd fraud_detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare your data:**
   - Place your transaction `.pkl` files in the data directory.

4. **Run the notebook:**
